## Summary

My determination to protect and restore biodiversity began as I grew up on an Illinois State Land and Water Reserve and traveled to national parks, refuges, and wilderness areas. While visiting Glacier National Park in 2008, I witnessed Ken Burns and his crew filming his national park documentary. When I viewed the film the next year, I was determined to make it to every U.S. national park. In June of 2016, a small Cessna landed on the sand dunes of Kobuk Valley National Park and my goal was achieved. 

Earning a B.S. in Zoology and a B.S. in Geography and Environmental Resources from Southern Illinois University Carbondale laid the foundation to approach problems from both the perspective of societal needs and from the perspective of wildlifeâ€™s needs. Internships with The Nature Conservancy, the National Forest Foundation, Cypress Creek National Wildlife Refuge, and the National Great Rivers Research and Education Center enhanced skills in public education/outreach, collaboration, meeting facilitation, stewardship, and field methods. I am currently pursuing a Master of Environmental Science and Management degree at the University of California Santa Barbara Bren School, specializing in Conservation Planning.
